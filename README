PDE Optickle Model

description of some scripts:

OMITmeas.m - shows an Optickle transfer function from a phase modulator 
to arm transmission while detuned, for showing the OMIT effect.

doubleOpticalSpring.m - Calculates the ETM modified mechanical response
due to radiation pressure effects given a certain amount of intra cavity 
modulation.

doubleSpringSearch.m - This will find the detuning that minimizes 
the amount of modulation needed to produce a stable double optical spring.

cucmberPDE.m - creates a cucumber (lentickle model) for PDE.

PDEloopgains.m - calculates the open loop transfer functions of the 
various length control loops using lentickle.
